Project Name: 
Who's That Pokemon

Description: 
This is a game I made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The game presents a silhouette image of a Pokemon and gives the player a chance to guess the name of that Pokemon. If the player guesses correctly, they earn a point. If the player guesses incorrectly, they do not get a point. Either way, the actual pokemon image and name are revealed.

Features: 

Bronze: When the user types in the correct name for the Ookemon (case insensitive) the Pokemon image is displayed. (complete) 

Silver: Pokemon are randomly generated from array as opposed to proceeding in order. Reset button sets score back to zero. Make it look prettier than it does (complete)

Gold: Add transitions to image changes. Add an option for a hint with a modal. Add audio. (All complete outside of 100% working audio)

Technologies: Uses exclusively HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Roadmap:
Future additions I am considering include: 
  - An end to the game where after x amount of guesses your score is tallied and a message is displayed grading your performance
  - Addition of more Pokemon into the array to choose from
  - Creation and usage of an API to randomly generate Pokemon instead of randomly selecting number for i from my created array.
  - Fix issue with slow loading of actual Pokemon images on mobile after user guesses Pokmon name
